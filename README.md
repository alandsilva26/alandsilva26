  ðŸ‘‹ **Hi I am Alan - a computer science engineer currently persuing my bachelors degree at [St. Francis Institute of Technology](https://www.sfit.ac.in/). I code for fun and professional reasons. Most of the time I am funny all the time. In my free time I like to play videogamesðŸŽ®. Occasionally I watch anime. I was in the school band so one might say that my taste in music is pretty loud.**
